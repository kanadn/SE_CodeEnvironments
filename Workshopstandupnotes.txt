Shean:
Worked on her SE group project. Read documentation, learned about their project code. 

Sarthak:
Started working on project. Needs to complete SE HWs and work more on project. Blocked in connecting frameworks and bot functionalites.

Kanad:
Working on ML HW. Need to complete ethics project and SE HW. Blocked with problems in ML HW.

DSM:
Very time consuming so should be limited to one short meeting a day which does not include solving individual problems. It is beneficial for the team to have brief standups. 
For SE Projects, we can have weekly standups instead of DSMs. This way we can summarize weekly work achievements, to-dos for next week and work on things blocking each member.
